# Stitches
An MLB scoreboard application built in Objective-C for iOS. The application make use of the STCMLBParser, which is currently rolled into this project but will later be moved into a CocoaPod or something similar.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to both familiarize myself with Objective-C and UIKit and to get more used to designing things in a (proper) MVC manner. There's a bit of the "Massive View Controller" issue going on right now, though.
